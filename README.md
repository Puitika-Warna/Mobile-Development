Hello Everyone...😁👋

We are from the CH2-PS088 Capstone Project Team. We are introducing the Puitika Warna, a Capstone Project of the program Bangkit Academy led by Google, Tokopedia, Gojek, & Traveloka

This application was created because the neglect of traditional fabric's unique origin and significance contributes to a loss of local identity. Meanwhile, the lack of information about traditional fabrics highlights the essential need for accessible tools to easily find information on traditional fabrics.

Puitika Warna is our innovation for Indonesia which provides insight into traditional fabrics. With features powered by Machine Learning, we bring the vibrant world of Batik, Songket, and more right to your fingertips. Explore the intricate motifs, the symphony of colors, and the profound meanings behind each fabric.
